Question 178

What is the result?
A. Found 3 at 2
B. Found 3 at 3
C. Compilation fails
D. An exception is thrown at runtime

-----------------------------
Answer: C

-----------------------------
Explanation: The following line does not compile:
System.out.print("Found " + key + "at " + pos);
The variable pos is undefined at this line, as its scope is only valid in the for loop.
Any variables created inside of a loop are LOCAL TO THE LOOP.
